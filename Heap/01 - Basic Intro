- Represent like a stack with size k
- Identify : K + smallest / largest

- k + smallest => use max heap
- k + largest => use min heap
- Sorting ques takes nlogn time , which can be done in nlogk using heap

- When smallest ask , it keeps largest elem on top until it exceeds the size , and start removing 
- At last we will have kth smallest at top
- That's why more kth smallest , we use max heap
