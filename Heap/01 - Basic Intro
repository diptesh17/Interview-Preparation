- Represent like a stack with size k
- Identify : K + smallest / largest
- k + smallest => max heap ( max element at top )
- k + latgest => min heap
- For sorting it takes nlogn but with heap it reduce to nlogk
- We can implement it using tree but prefer to use STL unless its not suggested

- Max heap = priority_queue < int > maxi;

- Min heap = priority_queue < int , vector<int> , greater<int> > mini;
