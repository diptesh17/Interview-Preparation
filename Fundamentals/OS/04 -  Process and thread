-- Program : An executable file , which comsist of compiled code and ready to be execute

-- Process : Program under execution, every process has its own memory

-- Thread : A light weight process, multi-threads actually shares the memory which is allocated to there process 

// Difference 

-- Multitasking : Deal with process + CPU = 1 + Isolation & memory protection + Context switch between more than one process

-- Multithreading : Process divides into multi threads + CPU >=1 + No memory isolation + Context switch between threads + Parallel execution ( async nature )
