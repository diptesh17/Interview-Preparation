-- Single : One process come , execute and leaves

-- Batch : 'n' number of processes comes , a computer operator batches them as per need and batch wise they execute

-- MultiProgramming : If process goes for i/o or other external operation , CPU dont remain idle it picks next process & result of prev kept in PCB

-- Multitasking : Context switching + time sharing , CPU idle time reduced further

-- MultiProcessing : More than one CPU + context switching + time sharing
