// Segmentation : It divides processes into smaller subparts known as modules 
                : They dont need to be placed in contiguous memory
                : Internal fragmentation doesn't occur here
                : In paging relative part of code may divided into pages
                : Code basically break downs into functions and this are loaded into memory
                : So it its executed , entire function will execute not half way
                : Now we are doing paging on basis of segmentation
