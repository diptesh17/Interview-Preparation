Two ways to allocate and manage memory based resources :

-> Fixed Partitioning : Memory is divided into blocks and each block will have same amount of space , relatively its easy to implement but leads to issues like
   internal fragmentations as processes can have varying memory requirements.

-> Dynamic Partitioning : Also known as variable Partitioning , it allocate & deallocates the memory as per size requirements.


// Partition and Memory allocation :

-> First fit : The first-fit algorithm allocates the first available memory block that is large enough to accommodate the process and it simply finds this using 
               simple scan through this array.

-> Best fit : The best-fit algorithm searches for the smallest available memory block that is large enough to accommodate the process. It aims to minimize leftover
              fragments by choosing the most optimal block

-> Worst fit : The worst-fit algorithm allocates the largest available memory block to the process. This approach intentionally keeps larger fragments to accommodate
              potential future larger processes.
