// Disk management : It means secondary memory like SSD & HDD 

// Disk's structure is CD like in which in every track , there are sectors

// Seek time : Head moves to & fro in x axis to determine which track to look

// Rotational latency : Once track found , now disk will rotate to find which sector i want 

// Disk scheduling algorithms :

-> FCFS : 
-> Shortest seed time first :
-> SCAN :
-> CSCAN :
