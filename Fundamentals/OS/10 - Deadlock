-- Deadlock : A process request for a resource which is used by another process so it wents to a waiting state and sometime its state never changes  as resource is
   busy forever is called as deadlock

-> It is a bug present in process/thread synchronization

-- Necessary conditions for deadlock ( Deadlock occur if all becomes true a instance )  : 
-> Mutual Exclusion : Resource shared in mutual manner , 2 process cant use same resource at an instance
-> Hold & wait : process wait for another resource by holding some resource
-> No preemption : Once process schedule , it will complete then only next process can schedule
-> Circular wait : All process wait for response in a cycle manner

-- Deadlock handling techniques :
-> Deadlock prevention : At least eliminate one of above 4 
-> Deadlock Avoidance : bankers algorithm
-> Deadlock recovery : Used to recover from deadlock once it  has been detected  
-> Deadlock ignorance : It will occur once in year , if occur then will close the system
