// Page fault : It occurs when we want some page but which is not present in the secondary memory

// Page hit : Jo requirement hai , that is present in secondary memory 

// Page replacement algorithms: 

-> First in first out : Frame size + pages will given 
-> Optimal page replacement : Best page replacement algo but not implementable
                            : Jo page abhi required hai keep it and jo future me hoga usko replace krdo 
-> Least recently used : Replace the one which is least recently used
